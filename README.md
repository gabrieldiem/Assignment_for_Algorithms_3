Project number 1 for the subject _Algorithms and Programming 3_ [75.07 - 95.02] at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Buenos Aires (FIUBA).

The documentation, variable names, and function names are mostly written in Spanish as it is the language in which the course is taught.

## Brief summary

This is an individual project that aims to apply the concepts of the object-oriented paradigm seen so far in the course by solving a problem with Pharo smalltalk.
A class model was developed using the TDD methodology. The initial specifications was an SUnit test file (.st) given in the form of use case tests. The solution generated allowed the specified tests to be run successfully while maintaining high coverage and avoiding the survival of mutants.

## Software used

| Software          | Version |
| ----------------- | ------- |
| Pharo (Smalltalk) | 9.0     |

## App

The source code for the project that can be imported from Iceberg (Pharo's piece of software to manage version control) as a repository is the `src` folder. Here you can find the classes and the unit tests.
In the `bin` folder there are source files that contain binary code so it can be imported directly into a Pharo live image.
The mutation test script and information about it are located inside the `mutalk` directory (mutation testing tool for Pharo smalltalk).
